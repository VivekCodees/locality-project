It includes features like search with suggestions and user authentication for secure data handling.

Features:
CRUD Operations: Users can add new localities, view existing localities, update details, and delete records.
Search Functionality: A powerful search feature with suggestions to help users find specific localities quickly.
User Authentication: Secure login system to protect access to locality data.
Responsive UI: Built using React and styled with Tailwind CSS for a seamless experience on all devices.

Tech Stack:
MongoDB: NoSQL database for flexible and scalable data storage.
Express.js: Backend framework to handle API routing and middleware.
React: Frontend library to build a dynamic and responsive user interface.
Node.js: JavaScript runtime for backend functionality and server-side operations.
